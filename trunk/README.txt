Features
--------

GridStatusHealTrace adds a status to Grid to show you who was healed by
your multi-target healing spells.

By default, it traces healing from Chain Heal, Circle of Healing, Divine
Hymn, Holy Nova, and Light of Dawn. You can add other heals to trace in
the status menu, under Grid > Statuses > Heal trace > Add new spell.

GridStatusHealTrace is loosely based on the old GridStatusChainWho by
Llyra, but it can be shown on icon indicators, it doesn't show crits
separately, and the spells are configurable. It was originally written
by Akkorian.
