Features
--------

GridStatusHealTrace adds a status to Grid to show you who was healed
by your multi-target healing spells.

By default, it traces healing from Chain Heal, Chi Burst, Chi Torpedo,
Chi Wave, Circle of Healing, Divine Hymn, Healing Sphere, Holy Nova,
Holy Radiance, Light of Dawn, Tranquility, Uplift, and Wild Mushroom:
Bloom. When you heal a group member with one of these spells, the status
will briefly appear to show you where your healing went.

You can configure how long the status is shown, or add other healing
spells to trace in the Grid options menu for the status.


Dependencies
------------

Obviously, you need Grid installed in order for this to do anything!

GridStatusHealTrace is loosely based on the old GridStatusChainWho by
Llyra, but it can be shown on icon indicators, it doesn't show crits
separately, and the spells are configurable. It was originally written
by Akkorian.
